		<strong>Instant Hand Rejuvenation</strong>
		<p>During the aging process the skin becomes loose and thin, due to loss of fat, which decreases overall volume and the essential youthfulness of the hands. This causes the veins to become more prominent, along with the tendons and bones. The hands are constantly subjected to the elements - sun, uv rays, heat, cold. Sun exposure is the main culprit of age and liver spots. Of course, it's not just the appearance that is affected - the feel of the hands are affected as well. The skin itself actually feels thin and crÃªpe-like, while bones feel more pronounced.</p>

It restores the fullness of the hands naturally, creating a youthful appearance.Ideal candidates for Instant Hand Rejuvenation are those who are experiencing any of the symptoms above that want to refreshen the look of their hands.</p>
