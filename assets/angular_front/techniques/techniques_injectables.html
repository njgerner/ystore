		<strong>Injectables</strong>
		<p>Recent advancements in injectables enable them to be used as an alternative to surgery, to immediately add volume to the area and create a more youthful appearance.</p>
		<p>These new products enable the modification of facial volumes, such as redefining the jaw line and cheeks, correcting wrinkles and folds and restoring the hands to a more youthful appearance without surgery.</p>
		<p>The area to be treated along with the desired result will determine which of the many available injectables is right for you.</p>
		<strong>We offer the following injectables:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>A strong and sharply defined mandibular angle – this is the angle that forms the rear of the face shape.</li>
			<li>A long, strong body of the mandible forming a near perfect straight line – this is the base of the face shape and the very foundation of a youthful face.</li>
			<li>A prominent chin, which can be squared off or slightly elevated, serving as the front-facing portion of the facial structure.</li>
			<li>Tracing down the sharp imaginary line from the high point of the cheek (located near the temple region) to the angle of the mandible (starting point).</li>
		</ul>
