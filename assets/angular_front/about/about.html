	<h2>About</h2>

			<h3>Our Unique Technique</h3>
			<img stlye="margin-left:10px" align="right" src="/img/y-face.png" />
			<p>Youthful facial contours are shaped like the letter “Y”. The face appears wide at the top in the eye and cheekbone region then narrows to a point at the chin. As we age, the arms of the “Y” shape begin to widen steadily downward. As this widening occurs, the youthful shape of the face begins to disappear and like a balloon, the face deflates and loses volume. The surface that was once taut becomes misshapen, wrinkled and sunken as a result of the aging process.</p>

			<h5>It requires no incisions, stitches or general anesthesia.</h5>
			<p>After years of study, Dr. Yan Trokel created a revolutionary minimally invasive facial contouring technique he calls the Y LIFT® that is based on a “structural volumizing” philosophy. In the aging process, volume and structure are what is gradually lost and absorbed by our bodies. </br>
			The Y LIFT® replenishes the lost volume and restores youthful facial contours. The uniqueness of the Y LIFT® is that it not only revives the ideal youthful shape, but also enhances and beautifies the natural features making the procedure suitable for persons of all ages. It accentuates the cheekbone region, revives the under eye area and defines the jawline and upper neck instantly.</p>

			<h5 style="text-decoration:underline">Structural Volumizing</h5>
			<p>The Y LIFT® procedure is performed using a specialized titanium instrument which is inserted beneath the skin and then maneuvered throughout designated parts of the facial region to instantly lift and contour the muscles, fascia and fat underlying the skin. Once lifted, hyaluronic acid, a substance that is naturally present in the skin is used to hold the newly elevated position in place at which point the titanium tube is removed from the treatment site. The rejuvenated face is then “sculpted” to accent and highlight each individual’s beauty.</p>
