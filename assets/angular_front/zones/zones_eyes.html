		<strong>Eyebrow / Forehead Lift</strong>
		<p>Brow lift surgery, also referred to as a forehead or eyebrow lift, uses tiny incisions along the hairline to allow the patient to achieve a younger, more refreshed look by smoothing the forehead, reducing frown lines, and elevating the position of the eyebrow line. The brow lift will make you appear years younger.</p>
